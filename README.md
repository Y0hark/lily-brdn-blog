This is the front-end of Lily Bardin's personal blog in NuxtJS + Vuetify + Strapi.
Code is free to use for the moment! It would be great though to tag me when you use this code ðŸ˜€

Thanks to all the stack that provides me free dev versions of their products.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
